      <description>Electrical engineering is definitely my biggest passion. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a career in this field. Especially &amp;ldquo;Digital Design&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Embedded Systems Engineering&amp;rdquo; are very integresting for me..
Everything started with the elective subject &amp;ldquo;Technology&amp;rdquo;, which I visited at the secondary school and taught me stuff like soldering and handling of simple circuits, on the other hand I dealt with the repair of old hi-fi equipment, which improved my understanding of analog circuits a lot.</description>

      <description>Music has always been important in my life. More or less often I play the guitar, listen to music and sometimes I try to produce/record my own music. When I was a teenager, I played in a few punkrock/metal-bands.

      <description>I got in touch with programming at an early age. As far as I can remember, everything started with Visual Basic. This was followed by experiments with HTML and CSS. Out of personal interest, I have always looked for other languages and made the first steps with websites, books and videos. I have found out that it works very well if you already have ideas or projects in mind, which require knownledge in the programming language.</description>

      <description>I have already gained much experience before graduation. On the recommendation of a friend and after a lot of trial and error with Ubuntu I first used Linux Mint as my productive operating system on my laptop and Windows quickly became irrelevant for me. At the beginning of my studies, I replaced my Windows &amp;amp; Linux laptop with a MacBook Pro, so at least I&amp;rsquo;m still working in an UNIX environment.</description>
