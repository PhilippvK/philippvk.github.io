My name is Philipp van Kempen, I'm from Germany and I would like to use this page to introduce myself, my opinion and my projects to you. There is so much stuff I am interested in.

Already when I was a young teenager, I started learning programming and web develeopment by myself. Computers and the internet always have been the center of my life beside friendships and music.
My interest in electronics came up after I bought an very old but awesome hifi stereo system , which was unfortunately broken. I spend much time understanding, repairing and reconditioning everything until everything worked fine and loved it, so later I was able to repair other amplifiers, tuners, record players and motitors by myself.

I decided to go to an school, where I could graduate my a-level in the subjects mathematics and infomation technology parallel to an training as an information technology assistant. I was able to deepen both of my passions here and beside earning lots of experiencens in topics like server operating systems, networks and object oriented programming, I was introduced in microcontrollers. After I realized many of my project with Raspberry Pi's before, I was then able to do even more... Most of the project I worked on focused on optimizing my workflows and for example my room. For example home automation, lights, music streaming, data logging, alarm systems and so on.

As I am playing the guitar since a long long time, music is very important to me,
