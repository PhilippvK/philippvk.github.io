I got in touch  with programming at an early age. As far as I can remember, everything started with Visual Basic. This was followed by experiments with HTML and CSS.
Out of personal interest, I have always looked for other languages and made the first steps with websites, books and videos. I have found out that it works very well if you already have ideas or projects in mind, which require knownledge in the programming language.

*I understand that some of these languages are not actually programming languages.*

Below you can see a (incomplete) listing of the languages I prefer.

### "The best of the best"
